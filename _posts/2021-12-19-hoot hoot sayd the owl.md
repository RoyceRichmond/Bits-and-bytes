Hey.
it's has been a while but hey I'm still alive, this last few months I've been very busy with the school and some other projects and haven't had time to write, but I'm back.

In the meantime I finished my first semester of my masters and I'm about to finish the second (the time flies D:), I build my first PC from the ground up, it was a terrifying experience to be honest, the part of getting all the parts was so slow, cof cof GPU shortage cof but once i had all the parts i build the test rig to see if it turn on and gave a video signal.

I tried for probably 20mn to secure the air cooler I was terrified of messing up anything, so after shaking like crazy, and been nervous I plug everything, short the power pins and it turn on (this mean that all the components were ok and i could move on)

And I've been moving all my files and installing programs, I'm thinking about starting a twitch channel of me doing stuff about electronics, i love the idea I'll post about it soon. Happy xmas and new years (if i don't update until then)

bye.
