Hey.

Ahh, February! 14th the perfect time to get good news, I guess ?

So I enrolled in this program called "LaunchX" sponsored (I don't really know how it works) by Microsoft where you have the chance to learn how to be a developer (FrontEnd and BackEnd), the first assignment was doing some python programs and upload the results, the programs were not that hard, but I can understand that it could be a little much if this is your first time at it (I forgot to mention that the program is open for everyone).

I pass that step, and now I wait for the FrontEnd course to begin, to be honest I never really cared about Web Development, but some projects I've in mind might benefit from it, so here we go, it's going to be interesting.

Btw I'm still at my Masters, and soon I'll start writing my Thesis.

bye
