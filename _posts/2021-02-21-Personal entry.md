Hey.

Tomorrow I start my first semester in the CIC, I'm thrilled about the new opportunities, the future that awaits and the unknown.

I can't wait for it to start, but I can't help to think about everything that has happened to me in all of this years, many persons have come and go, few friends have come and gone I still keep in touch with some of them.
And a pandemic has shown us the fragility of life, it has taken away from us many loved ones and has proven the importance of meaningful relationships, no man is an island.

I went down memory lane and remember my time at secondary school, saw pictures of my old school and remember how old was everything, I had to use encyclopedias for research, read books and use Encarta (kinda like a digital library, kinda old tbh), but still, everything was really simple, network television was awesome and i could listen to music, I had a PSP wich for me was amazing, the resolution of the screen, the games, oh man that feel like the future (I still have it, it works, but now I use it for retro gaming).

the high school was harder but still manageable, except for my trigonometry class I almost failed in that class, I had never had that feeling of not understanding something, trying and still failing a feeling that would follow me until this day (we have come to terms. We have a healthy relationship now, where it pushes me out of my comfort zone and I push back by studying and getting better). I meet a lot of people and even got my passion for electronics and electronic design kickstarted there, back then it looked like another school, you know 3 years of doing something and then I was going to go to college, but now I can see that I was wrong.

I meet so many great guys and gals, played videogames on some Nintendo DS that some peers lent me, find new passions and most important I change my mind about the IPN, I learned to love this institution, not by the installations nor the school, but for the people, professors and students. Now I see the pictures that I have from that time and honestly, I wish I had appreciated it more, it was gone very soon.

College was a different story I spend more time with peers, probably slept an average of 4 to 6 hours, embark on new projects, got frustrated for many tests; drank lots of soda, water and coffee, slept many times in a chair on the campus (I was really tired at the end of each semester and 10mn of sleep were the very best). I met my boo I love her so much, admire her work ethic, her sense of humour and overall personality (if you can see this, love you).

I don't know what the future holds for me, but I'll try to give my best and enjoy it
