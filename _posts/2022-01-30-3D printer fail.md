Hey.

So I guess that at this point everybody knows or knows somebody who knows or has a 3D printer, in case you've missed it (somehow ?) I present to you the 3D printer

Now that We've the same idea I'll continue, so I have a 3D printer that helped me many times through college, many projects (and way too many internet memes) were done on that printer, eventually I had to leave it cause I graduated and didn't need more pieces, so all is hunky-dory in the story c:.

Fast forward to some months, I wanted to print a chasis for a robot, sliced the model, fired up the printer and let it go but after a couple of minutes the printer's buzzer starts to sound, it rebooted and I as left wondering What the hell hapened.

So naturally I tried again, because if something fails you must try again under the same circumstances to see if it was a fluke (sometimes it is but most of the time it doesn't :sadface: ) i ended up with 3 fail prints and me wondering why it failed out of the blue, this is what happened next.
